## 🏗️ Foundation Layer: Basic OS Concepts

### 📍 Lesson 1: What is an Operating System?

**Prerequisites:** None - this is our starting point  
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner

**Core Concepts:**
- The OS as a resource manager and abstraction layer
- User space vs kernel space 
- System calls - how programs request services from the OS
- The role of the OS in managing processes, memory, and I/O

**Why This Matters for Your Project:**
Your pipeline system will use OS services to create threads, manage memory, and handle I/O operations. Understanding this relationship helps you appreciate why certain operations require special handling.

**Key Takeaway:** The OS provides the foundation that makes your multithreaded program possible.

---

### 📍 Lesson 2: Processes and Program Execution

**Prerequisites:** Lesson 1  
**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner

**Core Concepts:**
- What is a process? (running instance of a program)
- Process memory layout: code, data, heap, stack
- How programs start and execute
- Process lifecycle: creation, execution, termination
- Environment variables and command-line arguments

**Why This Matters for Your Project:**
Your main application is a process that will parse command-line arguments, load plugins dynamically, and manage the entire pipeline. Understanding process memory layout helps you manage memory correctly.

**Key Takeaway:** Your pipeline system starts as a single process that will later create multiple threads within itself.

---

## 🔄 Concurrency Foundation Layer

### 📍 Lesson 3: Introduction to Concurrency

**Prerequisites:** Lessons 1-2  
**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

**Core Concepts:**
- Sequential vs concurrent execution
- Why we need concurrency (performance, responsiveness, resource utilization)
- The difference between concurrency and parallelism
- Challenges of concurrent programming (race conditions, data corruption)

**Why This Matters for Your Project:**
Each plugin in your pipeline runs concurrently, processing different strings simultaneously. This is what makes your system efficient - while one plugin processes string A, another can process string B.

**Key Takeaway:** Concurrency enables your pipeline to process multiple strings simultaneously, but introduces complexity in coordination.

---

### 📍 Lesson 4: Threads - Lightweight Processes

**Prerequisites:** Lessons 1-3  
**Estimated Time:** 60 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

**Core Concepts:**
- What are threads? (lightweight execution units within a process)
- Threads vs processes (shared memory vs separate memory spaces)
- Thread creation, execution, and termination
- Thread scheduling by the OS
- POSIX threads (pthreads) library basics

**Why This Matters for Your Project:**
Each plugin in your pipeline runs in its own thread. All threads share the same process memory, which enables efficient communication through shared data structures.

**Key Takeaway:** Threads allow your single process to have multiple concurrent execution paths - one for each plugin.

---

## 🔒 Synchronization Layer

### 📍 Lesson 5: The Problem of Shared Data

**Prerequisites:** Lessons 1-4  
**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

**Core Concepts:**
- Race conditions - when threads access shared data simultaneously
- Critical sections - code that accesses shared resources
- Atomicity - operations that appear to happen instantaneously
- The need for synchronization mechanisms

**Why This Matters for Your Project:**
Your plugins communicate through shared queues. Without proper synchronization, multiple threads could corrupt these queues, leading to lost data or crashes.

**Key Takeaway:** When threads share data, you must coordinate their access to prevent corruption.

---

### 📍 Lesson 6: Mutexes - Mutual Exclusion

**Prerequisites:** Lessons 1-5  
**Estimated Time:** 60 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

**Core Concepts:**
- Mutex as a lock mechanism
- Only one thread can hold a mutex at a time
- Critical section protection
- pthread_mutex_t operations: init, lock, unlock, destroy
- Deadlock potential and prevention

**Why This Matters for Your Project:**
Your consumer-producer queues use mutexes to ensure only one thread modifies the queue at a time. This prevents data corruption when plugins add or remove items.

**Key Takeaway:** Mutexes provide exclusive access to shared resources, ensuring data integrity.

---

### 📍 Lesson 7: Condition Variables - Waiting for Events

**Prerequisites:** Lessons 1-6  
**Estimated Time:** 75 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Advanced

**Core Concepts:**
- Waiting for specific conditions to become true
- pthread_cond_t operations: init, wait, signal, broadcast, destroy
- The wait-signal pattern
- Why condition variables must be used with mutexes
- The spurious wakeup problem

**Why This Matters for Your Project:**
Your queues need to block threads when full (producer waits) or empty (consumer waits). Condition variables enable this efficient waiting without busy polling.

**Key Takeaway:** Condition variables allow threads to efficiently wait for specific conditions without wasting CPU cycles.

---

### 📍 Lesson 8: The Monitor Pattern ⭐ Critical for Your Project

**Prerequisites:** Lessons 1-7  
**Estimated Time:** 90 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Advanced

**Core Concepts:**
- Combining mutex + condition variable + state flag
- Solving the "missed signal" problem
- Manual vs automatic reset semantics
- State persistence between signals and waits

**Why This Matters for Your Project:**
Your assignment specifically requires implementing a monitor to prevent race conditions where signals are sent before threads start waiting. This is a crucial building block for your queues.

**Key Takeaway:** Monitors provide "stateful" synchronization that remembers signals until they're consumed.

---

## 💬 Communication Layer

### 📍 Lesson 9: Producer-Consumer Pattern ⭐ Critical for Your Project

**Prerequisites:** Lessons 1-8  
**Estimated Time:** 90 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Advanced

**Core Concepts:**
- Producer threads generate data, consumer threads process data
- Bounded vs unbounded queues
- Blocking vs non-blocking operations
- Queue full and queue empty conditions
- Circular buffer implementation

**Why This Matters for Your Project:**
Your entire pipeline is built on producer-consumer relationships. Each plugin consumes from its input queue and produces to the next plugin's queue.

**Key Takeaway:** Producer-consumer queues enable decoupled communication between pipeline stages.

---

### 📍 Lesson 10: Thread-Safe Data Structures

**Prerequisites:** Lessons 1-9  
**Estimated Time:** 75 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Advanced

**Core Concepts:**
- Thread safety definition and requirements
- Implementing thread-safe operations
- Invariant preservation under concurrent access
- Queue operations: enqueue, dequeue, size checking
- Memory management in multithreaded environments

**Why This Matters for Your Project:**
Your consumer_producer_t structure must maintain its invariants (count, head, tail relationships) even when multiple threads access it simultaneously.

**Key Takeaway:** Thread-safe data structures maintain their correctness guarantees under concurrent access.

---

## 🎭 Advanced Coordination Layer

### 📍 Lesson 11: Thread Lifecycle Management

**Prerequisites:** Lessons 1-10  
**Estimated Time:** 60 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

**Core Concepts:**
- Thread creation with pthread_create
- Thread termination and cleanup
- Joining threads with pthread_join
- Detached vs joinable threads
- Graceful shutdown patterns

**Why This Matters for Your Project:**
Your main application must coordinate the lifecycle of all plugin threads, ensuring they start properly and shut down cleanly when <END> is received.

**Key Takeaway:** Proper thread lifecycle management ensures clean startup and graceful shutdown.

---

### 📍 Lesson 12: Pipeline Coordination Patterns ⭐ Critical for Your Project

**Prerequisites:** Lessons 1-11  
**Estimated Time:** 75 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Advanced

**Core Concepts:**
- Chaining processing stages
- Backpressure and flow control
- Graceful shutdown propagation
- End-of-stream signaling
- Thread synchronization for shutdown

**Why This Matters for Your Project:**
When <END> is received, it must propagate through the entire pipeline, causing each plugin to finish its work and shut down in order.

**Key Takeaway:** Pipeline systems require coordinated shutdown to ensure all data is processed and no work is lost.

---

## 🔌 System Integration Layer

### 📍 Lesson 13: Dynamic Loading and Linking ⭐ Critical for Your Project

**Prerequisites:** Lessons 1-12  
**Estimated Time:** 75 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

**Core Concepts:**
- Static vs dynamic linking
- Shared objects (.so files) and shared libraries
- Runtime loading with dlopen, dlsym, dlclose
- Symbol resolution and function pointers
- Plugin architectures and interfaces

**Why This Matters for Your Project:**
Your main application loads plugins at runtime based on command-line arguments. This flexibility allows users to construct different pipeline configurations without recompiling.

**Key Takeaway:** Dynamic loading enables modular, extensible architectures where components can be loaded on demand.

---

### 📍 Lesson 14: Interface Design and SDK Development

**Prerequisites:** Lessons 1-13  
**Estimated Time:** 60 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

**Core Concepts:**
- Defining stable interfaces between components
- Function pointer contracts
- API design principles
- Shared infrastructure vs plugin-specific logic
- Code reuse through common libraries

**Why This Matters for Your Project:**
Your plugin SDK defines the contract that all plugins must follow, while plugin_common.c provides shared infrastructure that eliminates code duplication.

**Key Takeaway:** Well-designed interfaces enable modular development and code reuse.

---

## 🧠 Memory Management Layer

### 📍 Lesson 15: Memory Management in Multithreaded Programs

**Prerequisites:** Lessons 1-14  
**Estimated Time:** 60 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

**Core Concepts:**
- Heap vs stack memory in threaded programs
- Memory ownership and transfer
- Avoiding memory leaks in complex systems
- String handling and lifecycle management
- Resource cleanup patterns

**Why This Matters for Your Project:**
Your pipeline transfers string ownership between plugins. Each plugin must carefully manage memory to avoid leaks while ensuring strings remain valid for the next stage.

**Key Takeaway:** Clear ownership semantics prevent memory leaks and use-after-free bugs in complex systems.
