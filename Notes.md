# üöÄ Final Assignment - Complete Implementation Roadmap

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED:
- [x] Monitor implementation (monitor.c, monitor.h)
- [x] Monitor comprehensive tests (9/9 passing)
- [x] Git workflow and branch management
- [x] Build script setup and fixes
- [x] Consumer-producer header file (consumer_producer.h)
- [x] Consumer-producer structure definition
- [x] consumer_producer_init() implementation 

## üîß CURRENT WORK - Consumer-Producer Queue:
- [x] consumer_producer_destroy() - free memory and destroy monitors
- [x] consumer_producer_put() - add items (blocks when full)
- [x] consumer_producer_get() - remove items (blocks when empty)   
- [x] consumer_producer_signal_finished() - signal shutdown 
- [x] consumer_producer_wait_finished() - wait for shutdown 
- [ ] consumer_producer_test.c - comprehensive tests ‚≠ê
- [ ] Update build.sh to compile consumer-producer test
- [ ] Run and debug consumer-producer tests

## üìã REMAINING MAJOR COMPONENTS:

### Plugin Infrastructure:
- [ ] plugin_common.h - shared plugin infrastructure
- [ ] plugin_common.c - common plugin implementation
- [ ] plugin_sdk.h - plugin interface definitions

### Individual Plugins:
- [ ] logger.c - logs strings to stdout
- [ ] typewriter.c - prints with 100ms delay per character
- [ ] uppercaser.c - converts to uppercase
- [ ] rotator.c - rotates characters right by 1
- [ ] flipper.c - reverses string order
- [ ] expander.c - adds spaces between characters

### Main Application:
- [ ] main.c - pipeline orchestration
  - [ ] Command-line argument parsing
  - [ ] Dynamic plugin loading (dlopen/dlsym)
  - [ ] Plugin initialization and chaining
  - [ ] STDIN input processing
  - [ ] Graceful shutdown on <END>
  - [ ] Error handling and cleanup

### Build & Test:
- [ ] Update build.sh for all plugins
- [ ] Create test.sh - comprehensive system tests
- [ ] Test individual plugins
- [ ] Test complete pipeline chains
- [ ] Test error conditions and edge cases

### Final Submission:
- [ ] Clean up all TODO comments
- [ ] Remove debug prints (keep only pipeline output)
- [ ] Verify build.sh works on fresh system
- [ ] Test on Ubuntu 24.04 with gcc 13
- [ ] Create proper README file
- [ ] Final zip file structure verification

## üìä PROGRESS ESTIMATE:
- **Completed**: ~25% (Monitor + Consumer-Producer setup)
- **Current Sprint**: ~15% (Consumer-Producer implementation)
- **Remaining**: ~60% (Plugins + Main + Testing)

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
1. Finish consumer_producer_destroy() üî®
2. Implement put() with circular buffer logic
3. Implement get() with blocking behavior
4. Test consumer-producer thoroughly
5. Move to plugin infrastructure

## üìù NOTES:
- Circular buffer: head/tail pointers, wrap around at capacity
- Blocking: use monitors for thread synchronization
- Memory: strings are owned by queue, caller gets ownership on get()
- Error handling: return descriptive strings, NULL on success
- Testing: comprehensive tests prevent debugging hell later!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEADLINE: August 31st, 2025 at 23:59

**Current Status**: Working on consumer_producer_destroy() üîß

*Last updated: Ready to implement destroy function!*
